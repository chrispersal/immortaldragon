# Kill the Immortal Dragon

You can't, but you can use him to grind. He won't mind, probably.

Ideally, on a longer scale, I'd add a secondary currency as a random drop (gold coins maybe), so upgrades are bought with that instead of dealt damage, primarily because it doesn't make sense to heal the dragon in order to buy weapons. Every damage point has a 25% chance of dropping a gold coin, and a 5% chance of dropping 5.
